# ZSH-Environment

A zsh environment setup with oh-my-zsh, plugins and themes.
This is my personal zsh environment setup that I use across multiple machines.

- Raspberry Pi's
- UnRAID
- MacOS
- Linux
- Docker containers

## Commands

- `make help` list all commands
- `make install` run interactive script locally
- `make test-alpine-build` to build and test in alpine container
